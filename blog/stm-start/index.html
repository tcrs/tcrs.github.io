    <h1>Getting started using the STM32 platform</h1>
    <p>See <a href="https://github.com/tcrs/stm-start">this GitHub repo</a> for the related code
(and a copy of this post).</p>
<p>I have an <a href="http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Arch_Max">Arch Max</a> STM32F4 development board. Although it <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Seeed-Arch-Max/">supports
mbed</a> I like to understand how things work...</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/dm00037051.pdf">datasheet</a> and <a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00031020.pdf">reference manual</a> have all the required
low-level hardware info. This guide will get you started compiling C programs to
directly twiddle with the stuff from the reference manual.</p>
<p>I experimented with two ways to get started on the board: CMSIS and libopencm3.
I preferred libopencm3 and that's what I'm using now, but have included examples
using both. The toolchain and debugging stuff is the same between the two.</p>
<h2 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h2>
<p>On Arch Linux, just install the <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> and <code>arm-none-eabi-newlib</code>
packages. Most other distros probably offer similarly named packages.</p>
<h1 id="openocd">OpenOCD</h1>
<p>An <code>openocd</code> config file is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Arch_Max.git">Arch Max git repo</a>.
Then running <code>openocd -f Arch_Max/arch_max.cfg</code> with the board connected to a
USB port should pick it up and provide a GDB server on port <code>3333</code>. I have to
run OpenOCD as root as it needs access to the <code>/dev/hidraw0</code> device node to
communicate with the board.</p>
<h1 id="gdb">GDB</h1>
<p>Once OpenOCD is running and connected to the board via USB <code>gdb</code> can be
connected and used to run and debug binaries. </p>
<pre style="background-color:#fdf6e3;">
<code><span style="color:#657b83;">arm-none-eabi-gdb -x load.gdb binary.elf
</span></code></pre>
<p>The gdb script <code>load.gdb</code> will connect to the OpenOCD gdb server, reset the
board and load the elf file into memory. You can continue (<code>c</code>) at the GDB
prompt to just run the program. For debugging you can set breakpoints etc before
running too.</p>
<p>TOOD:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to program an image into flash</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>Both the libopencm3 and the CMSIS examples will produce a binary which when run
on the Arch Max board will blink the LED next to the ethernet port (GPIO B3).</p>
<p>The Makefiles in both examples will link an elf executable file, which is
suitable for debugging and loading via GDB (see above). A further <code>objcopy -O binary</code> step (also shown in the Makefiles) provides a file suitable for flashing
onto the chip's flash memory (I think - I've not got around to actually trying
this yet!).</p>
<h2 id="using-libopencm3">Using libopencm3</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://libopencm3.org/">libopencm3</a> project provide an free software library which is
in many ways similar to CMSIS, but I found it easier to get started with and it
is what I use for projects now. Note that despite the name it also supports a
large range of Cortex-M4 devices!</p>
<p>There is an awk script (<code>libopencm3/scripts/gnlink.awk</code>) which can generate the
required C flags and linker script for a device, see
<code>example-libopencm3/Makefile</code> for usage.</p>
<p>The generated linker script sets the executable entry point to <code>reset_handler</code>
which can be found in <code>libopencm3/lib/cm3/vector.c</code>. This is pretty minimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>clears the BSS</li>
<li>makes sure the stack is aligned correctly</li>
<li>calls pre_main, which may do chip-specific init. For the STM32F4 boards it
just enabled access to the floating point unit</li>
<li>calls global constructors</li>
<li>calls main() - provided by you!</li>
<li>calls global destructors</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the clocks are left in their reset state. In the example I have
set them up (using the <code>rcc_clock_setup_hse_3v3</code> function) to run at 168MHz. The
settings there are correct for the Arch Max (I hope!) as it has a high-speed
external (hse) 8MHz oscillator.</p>
<p>Using the functions in libopencm3 to do simple things like toggling the GPIO is
probably rather wasteful as they each incur a function call overhead. If you are
worried about this then you can build the libopencm3 library and your binary
with link-time optimisation (LTO), which will inline any small functions the
compiler thinks is wise.</p>
<h2 id="using-cmsis">Using CMSIS</h2>
<p>I found it very difficult to find the CMSIS code. It turns out the best way to
get hold of it for a platform with mbed support (which is quite a lot, including
the Arch Max) is to just grab the mbed source code from <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git">mbed-os GitHub
repo</a>. The repository contains lots of stuff for mbed and mbed-os, but the
interesting CMSIS code is in the <code>targets</code> folder.</p>
<p>Each supported chip has a folder containing a chip-specific startup assembly
file. For the Arch Max this is in <code>mbed-os/targets/TARGET_STM/TARGET_STM32F4/TARGET_STM32F407xG/device/TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM/startup_stm32f407xx.S</code>
This assembly file contains the entry point (<code>Reset_Handler</code>) and quite well
documented with comments - it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets up the stack</li>
<li>Copies data segment from flash to RAM</li>
<li>Calls <code>SystemInit</code> to init clock and other basic hardware init</li>
<li>Calls <code>_start</code> (which is the libc entry point that will call main)</li>
<li>Provides the interrupt vector table
<ul>
<li>Default handler just enters an infinite loop</li>
<li>Set up to have a weak symbol for each interrupt, aliased to the default one</li>
<li>Can easily provide an interrupt handler by just creating a function of the
correct name (e.g. <code>EXTI0_IRQHandler</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same folder as the startup <code>.S</code> file there should be a linker script
(<code>.ld</code>) which should be passed to the linker with the <code>-T</code> option. This is also
quite well commented.</p>
<p>An implementation of <code>SystemInit</code> for the Arch Max is provided
(<code>mbed-os/targets/TARGET_STM/TARGET_STM32F4/TARGET_STM32F407xG/TARGET_ARCH_MAX/system_stm32f4xx.c</code>)
which sets up the system clock and various other bits and bobs. This
implementation calls into the HAL library (sources for which can be found at
<code>mbed-os/targets/TARGET_STM/TARGET_STM32F4/device/</code>). I have provided a chopped
down version <code>system_light.c</code> which does not depend on the HAL library.</p>
<p>The mbed files for your board should have some clues as to what pins are
connected to the odd LEDs etc. which are probably on your board. For the Arch
Max that was in
<code>mbed-os/targets/TARGET_STM/TARGET_STM32F4/TARGET_STM32F407xG/TARGET_ARCH_MAX/PinNames.h</code></p>
<ul>
<li>at the bottom <code>LED1</code> is set to <code>PB_3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The provided <code>Makefile</code> shows the compiler/linker options and include paths required.</p>
<p>See example in the <code>example-cmsis</code> folder (note you'll need that checkout of
<code>mbed-os</code> - see the readme in the folder).</p>
