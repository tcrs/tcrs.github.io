    <h1>Building a custom keyboard</h1>
    <p>I made a custom keyboard design, the <a href="https://github.com/tcrs/ergosnap">ErgoSnap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>A while ago I built an <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Iris keyboard</a> from a kit because I wanted to try
a split layout. I'm pretty happy with it but after using it for a few months
decided I would like a few more keys. I had a look at what else was available,
and after spending a lot of time on the internet decided that the layout of the
<a href="https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash">ErgoDash</a> looked good. I liked the construction of the
<a href="https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware">Mitosis</a> using a single PCB design for both the mounting plate and the
actual PCB the switches are soldered to; however I didn't want a wireless
keyboard and wanted to stick with the <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> firmware. So I decided to adapt
the ErgoDash design to use the Mitosis construction.</p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>Since I was designing my own keyboard I can tailor it to my requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tenting built in. Just need two M6 mounting holes on the inside edge of the board</li>
<li>Don't care about any kind of lighting</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose to use the diode mounting holes in the keyswitches - these are wider
than the LED mounting holes (but in the same location on the keyswitch). They
are in the Cherry MX <a href="http://switches-sensors.zf.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Keymodule_MX_EN.pdf">datasheet</a> (found by searching around on the internet). I'm
using <a href="https://zealpc.net/products/zealio">Zealios</a> and the ones I've got definitely have the diode holes. This
simplified routing as the diode overlaps the switch.</p>
<p>I created a custom component and footprint with the keyswitch, diode and cutouts
for snapout section (for the mounting plate PCB). Added a chin at the top for
the ProMicro, used the reversible ProMicro footprint from <a href="https://github.com/Biacco42/Ergo42">Ergo42</a>.</p>
<p>Ordered PCBs from JLC PCB:</p>

<p>First set of PCBs arrived and looked good, but...</p>

</figure>
<p>the holes for the diode legs were not the right distance apart! Whoops. Luckily
PCBs are pretty cheap so a couple of weeks later I had revised boards. Only a
few mistakes remain now. See the <a href="https://github.com/tcrs/ergosnap">ErgoSnap</a> github repo for more info.</p>
